## Description
### Baseline (within 24 hours of ICU admission) characteristics:
This tabular dataset contains the following baseline (collected with 24 hours of ICU admission) variables associated with each unique patient identifier (`UPI`): age at ICU admission, sex, days between ED admission and ICU admission, list of active problems upon presentation to the ICU, indicators of cerebrovascular accident (`CVA`), intracranial hemorrhage (`ICH`), subarachnoid hemorrhage (`SAH`), brain tumor or legion, subdural hematoma or extradural hematoma (`SDHOrEDH`), and traumatic brain injury (`TBI`), the worst glasgow coma scale (GCS) component and total scores, temperature (F), mean arterial pressure (MAP) in mmHg, heart rate (HR) in bpm, respiratory rate (RespRate) in bpm, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) in %, arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) in mmHg, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) in mmHg, arterial pH, blood sodium level (Na) in mEq/L, blood potassium level (K) in mmol/L, blood creatinine level in mg/dL, incidence of acute renal failure, hematocrit (HCT) in %, white blood cell count (WBC) in 10^9/L, incidence of severe organ failure, incidence of brain surgery, incidence of emergency surgery, Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, and APACHE II mortality risk.
### Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) assessments during hospital stay:
Contains neurological assessments (according to the Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS]) conducted by nurses and physicians at the Johns Hopkins Hospital for each patient in the NIMS study during their stay.

The tabular file contains unique patient identifiers (`UPI`), hours from ICU (i.e., NCCU) admission, the time of day of the assessment, the total GCS (`GCST`) as well as its 3 components (motor - `GCSm`, eye - `GCSe`, and verbal - `GCSv`), and a boolean variable indicating whether the assessment coincided with our accelerometry recoding times.
### Temporal clinical metadata of study patients:
This tabular file contains, per each unique patient identifier (`UPI`): the time of day of ICU admission, the time of day of ICU discharge, the number of days in the ICU, the number of days between ED admission and ICU admission, the number of days between ICU admission and hospital discharge, the number of days in hospital, the number of hours between ICU admission and accelerometry recording start, the time of day when accelerometry recording started, the number of hours between ICU admission and accelerometry recording end, the time of day when accelerometry recording ended, and the accelerometry recording duration in hours.
### Clinical outcomes:
NIMS study patient outcomes, containing the following information: days in the ICU, days in the hospital, death during ICU stay, death during Hospital stay, Glasgow Outcome Scale - Extended (GOSE) score at discharge, modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at discharge, death at 12 months post-discharge, GOSE at 12 months post-discharge, mRS at 12 months post-discharge, and destination after hospital discharge.
